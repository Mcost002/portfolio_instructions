## Tips

* Think about who you want to view your site (potential employers, freelance opportunities, friends). I know it is tempting to make it flashy with tons of jQuery plugins, but the most important thing when designing your site is to make it EASY for your visitors to access the information they want and navigate around the page.

* Think about the goal for your site and what you want your users to do (read about your story, look at your work/code/writing, contact you). Guide them to taking those actions by making them prominent / easy to find.

* Wireframe what you want your site to look like first!

* Use proper indentation and organize your code. Chances are people will view your source!

* You may use Bootstrap or other CSS frameworks. If you do, you're encouraged to start off using it so that you get an idea of how you want your page to look, and then to gradually remove the Bootstrap in favor of CSS you wrote yourself.
